## What is 5erver?

**5erver is the local host file server for everyone.**

- 5erver allows you to be in full control of your data.
- 5erver allows anyone on your wifi to see the files, but no one outside can.
- 5erver2 allows you to upload files *directly* from the website, rather than using the previous long command line input.
- 5erver is stylized to be easy on the eyes, while providing enough detail to show you exactly what you need, whenever you see it. 
- 5erver is customizable.
