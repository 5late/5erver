**What is 5erver?**

*Update on Jan 27 2021*
5erver now officially supports the following file types:
-mp4
-webm
-mov
-mkv
-mp3
-jpg
-png

However, HTML5 only has support for playing mp4 and webm videos in the browser. As a result, all other video files will not stream off the Pi, but rather prompt a download onto your machine. These HTML-unsupported files will still show up on the webpage, so it is still possible to download them on other machines from the server.

-----

5erver is a locally hosted file server.

Files are uploaded via SCP (secure copy) to a Raspberry Pi running an Apache server.

The files are then available for viewing at the website. (The website is the ip assigned to the Raspberry Pi.)


**Why Use 5erver?**


The use for a locally hosted file system is simple. It allows you to have a dedicated space for large files (videos/images/etc). 

Having your files locally hosted rather than in the Cloud allows you to have complete control over your own data without fear of privacy related issues.
