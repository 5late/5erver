# 5erver

**What is 5erver?**


5erver is a locally hosted video* file server.

Files are uploaded via SCP (secure copy) to a Raspberry Pi running an Apache server.

The files are then available for viewing at the website. (The website is the ip assigned to the Raspberry Pi.)

*The file server can be tweaked to support other file types/other formats if familiar with the JavaScript code.

**Why Use 5erver?**


The use for a locally hosted file system is simple. It allows you to have a dedicated space for large files (videos/images/etc). 

Having your files locally hosted rather than in the Cloud allows you to have complete control over your own data without fear of privacy related issues.
